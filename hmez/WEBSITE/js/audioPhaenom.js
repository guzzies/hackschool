//welcome to audioPhaenom.
//this is a javaScript by Dominik Mezler (@bluewingtitan/HMeZ)
//feel free to modify and use the script for your own purposes,
//for more infos, look up for the licence4audioPhaenom.md file, that you should find in the same folder as this file.
//the license is only suitable for audioPhaenom, not for the tracks, you can play with audioPhaenom on my website.
//This Version of audioPhaenom contains some code, wich is using Mousetrap! I can't provide any licence for Mousetrap, search up for it and include it in your Project externaly,
//if you want to use audioPhaenom with the additional Mousetrap-functionality.

//At first, lets set up the error-messeages:
var err_noSong =`[audioPhaenom:] No songs are defined.`;
var err_songUndefined = `[audioPhaenom:] No song found under " ${err_path} " !`

var err_path = 'undefined'; //this var will be used in a future update, to specify the error-messeage from audioPhaenom with the id err_songUndefined.

//now setup your playlist.
var songs = ['./tracks/1.mp3', './tracks/2.mp3', './tracks/3.mp3', './tracks/4.mp3']; //the source-array.
var names = ['Ausnahmetalent', 'pulse.', 'Reflect', 'Wei√üe Augen III']; //the songtitle-array
