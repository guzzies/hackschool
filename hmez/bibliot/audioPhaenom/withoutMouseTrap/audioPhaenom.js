//welcome to audioPhaenom.
//this is a javaScript by Dominik Mezler (@bluewingtitan/HMeZ)
//feel free to modify and use the script for your own purposes,
//for more infos, look up for the licence4audioPhaenom.md file, that you should find in the same folder as this file.
//the license is only suitable for audioPhaenom, not for the tracks, you can play with audioPhaenom on my website.
//This script is ment for useage without mousetrap, if you want to be able to use it with key-bindings, you may use
//the version compatible with mousetrap and mousetrapJS itself :D


//At first, lets set up the error-messeages:
var errorNotes = {
  err_noSong: '[audioPhaenom:] No songs are defined.',
  err_songUndefined: '[audioPhaenom:] No song found under !',
  errNoSong: function(alertError) {
    console.error(err_noSong);
    if (alertError === true) {
      alert(err_noSong);
    }
  },
  undefined: function(path, alertError) {
    console.error(err_songUndefined + path + " !");
    if (alertError === true) {
      alert(err_songUndefined + path + " !");
    }
  }
}

//now setup your playlist.
var playlist = {
  songs: ['./tracks/1.mp3', './tracks/2.mp3', './tracks/3.mp3', './tracks/4.mp3'], //the source-array.
  names: ['Ausnahmetalent', 'pulse.', 'Reflect', 'Wei√üe Augen III'], //the songtitle-array
  artists: ['HMeZ', 'HMeZ', 'HMeZ', 'HMeZ'], //the artists-array
  albums: ['pulse.', 'pulse.', 'pulse.', 'pulse.'], //the albumName-array
  maxIndex: 3 //the number of songs, you've definded minus one.
